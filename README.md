# Low Level Design (LLD) Learnings  

Welcome to my **LLD Learnings Repository**  
This repo is a collection of **system design concepts, solutions, and intuitive practices** I’m following to master **Low-Level Design (LLD)** in Java.  

---

## What’s Inside?  
- Core OOP Principles – Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction  
- SOLID Principles – Writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code  
- Design Patterns – Creational, Structural, Behavioral with examples  
- LLD Case Studies – Hands-on implementations of real-world problems  
- UML Diagrams – Visual representation before coding  
- Best Practices – Intuitive ways to write extensible design  

---

## Tech Stack  
- Language: Java  
- UML Tools: PlantUML / Excalidraw  
- IDE: VS Code  

---

## Learning Philosophy  
> "LLD is like LEGO – build small reusable blocks (classes & interfaces) and connect them to form large scalable systems."  

I’m learning and practicing LLD in an **intuitive, hands-on way**:  
1. Break problem → Identify entities & responsibilities  
2. Apply OOP & SOLID → Ensure extensibility  
3. Add Design Patterns → Where they naturally fit  
4. Draw UML → To visualize relationships  
5. Code in Java → To solidify the design

## Roadmap (Stay Tuned)  
- Week 1 → Basics of OOP & SOLID  
- Week 2 → Creational Design Patterns  
- Week 3 → Structural & Behavioral Design Patterns  
- Week 4 → Advanced LLD Case Studies & Concurrency
